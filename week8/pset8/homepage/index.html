            <p>
              I was born in 1964 in Heidelberg, Germany and live in Switzerland since 1982. So I am actually Swiss now.
              I was studying Biological Chemistry and Information Technology at the University of Zürich, which was very new at that time.
              Then I also studied physical education at ETH Zürich.
              I have a bunch of hobbies, sports, music, drawing and photography and I love animals.
              I had a professional career in IT, with the focus on Oracle, Linux, Infrastructure and Security.
              Now I decided to strengthen my coding skills... I am still hungry and motivated to learn new stuff.
              I love the CS50 course and enjoy how the topics are presented. My favourite pset so far was fiftyville.
              For this pset, i decided to link some examples from my music and drawings. Feel free to explore and contact me, if you wish.
