Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

with N = 10 the prediction was incorrect, with N = 100 the winner was the same as with N=1000000.
As of N = 1000, the first 5 teams stayed in the same rank

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
for the winner, i would consider N=100 as good enough
